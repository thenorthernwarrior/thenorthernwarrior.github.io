			<h2>BBEdit</h2>
			<p>I've been trying to code WYSIWYG(pronounced wiz-ee-wig) editor for BBCode. It supports plugins for different forum sites,
				useful tools for styling, storing drafts of posts, and even a Direct Post button. If anyone would like to help with
				that idea, I would appreciate it.
